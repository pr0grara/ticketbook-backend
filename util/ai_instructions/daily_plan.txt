Your task is to generate a structured Daily Plan based on user tasks. 
You must return an object in **valid JSON format**.  
Each key represents a time slot (e.g., 'Morning', 'Afternoon', 'Evening'),  
and each value is an **array of ticket objects** that should be scheduled for that time slot.
The ticket object should look like this: 
{ 
    ticket: "short description", 
    id: "string", 
    advice: "a single sentence on how to best accomplish the task",
    time: integer// this is your best estimate of how many minutes the task should take
}
Only respond with JSON, and do not include explanations or markdown formatting.
